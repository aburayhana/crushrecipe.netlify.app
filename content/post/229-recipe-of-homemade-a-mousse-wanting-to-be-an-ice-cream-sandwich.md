- "Using a hand or stand mixer, whip until foamy.  Pop it in the freezer for 2 mins.  Take it outta the freezer and continue whipping for another 2 mins.  Return it back to the freezer and repeat the steps until the coconut cream is whipped to a thick consistency with soft peaks."

Transfer into a piping bag."

- "Assemble the mousse.  Using the same pastry ring, cut out discs from the swirl bread.  Spread kewpie mayo on 1 side only.  Toast, mayo side down, until crispy."
- "Transfer onto serving plate toasted side down.  Remove the mousse from the freezer.  Carefully, using a blow torch to heat up the pastry ring for easy unmolding.  Slide the mousse onto the toasted bread."
- "Pipe the meringue onto the mousse.  Decorate the sides with toasted coconut flakes.  Lastly, carefully blowtorch the meringue until lightly browned.  Serve immediately."

- "7 - 8 cloves chopped garlic"
- "10 - 12 nos shallots chopped"

- "2  - 3 teaspoons red chilli powder Can add more of course  As you like it"
- "3/4 teaspoon turmeric powder"
- "2 - 3 pinchs fenugreek powder  can add seeds alternatively along with mustard seeds"
- "as required water"
- "to taste salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the fish thoroughly and keep aside. Make sure to change water and wash couple of times. (Good to use rock salt or just normal salt to brush over the pieces while cleaning.) Any fish will do as long as it is fresh."
- "In a wok, heat coconut oil, splutter the mustard seeds and curry leaves. Once the seeds crackle, add the chopped ginger, garlic and shallots. Saute well for 2-3 minutes until raw smell goes."

- "Now- add the fish pieces and the kudampuli pieces. Add some more salt if required, pour in enough water to cover it all and let it cook on medium flame until the fish is cooked well, it should take about 10-15 minutes. (Kerala fish curry is best cooked in clay pots, so move them there right now, if you got one. But it is better to do the initial steps before adding fish in a normal wok so that you can the frying done fast)"
- "Time to taste, open and check and adjust salt if required."
- "It is ready to go into your tummy but my mom is law does a second round of seasoning here, making it even yummier. If you don&#39;t mind some more oil-take a small wok, heat a teaspoon coconut oil, splutter few mustard seeds and add curry leaves and some chopped shallots and fry them until you get a dark brown charred effect and just pour if over your curry."

recipeingredient:
- "2 cans coconut milk"
- "2 tablespoons of powder sugar or more to taste"
- "1/2 tsp vanilla extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place 2 cans of pure coconut milk in your refrigerator over night."
- "Also place your mixing bowl in your refrigerator over night."
- "Open your cans of coconut milk but DO NOT SHAKE THE CANS UP. You want the coconut milk to be a solid cream. Before you scoop the thick cream from the cans, make a small hole in the cream and drain the excess coconut milk that has separated from the cream and settled on the bottom into a fine mesh strainer into a bowl or container, chill and save the liquid for other recipes."
- "Scoop cream into your chilled bowl and start to beat right away on high.  Once it starts getting thicker, add your sugar and extract, both are optional. I like it lightly sweet and with no extract, just the natural coconut flavor. Once it looks like heavy whipped cream and is stiff, standing on it&#39;s own off the beaters, when you shut off the mixer, you are done!. It&#39;s refreshing and delicious plus it&#39;s all natural and VERY low in cals and fat. Perfect way to have your sweet treat while keeping on track! ;)"

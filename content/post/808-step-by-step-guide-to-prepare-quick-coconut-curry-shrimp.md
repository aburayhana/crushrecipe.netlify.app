recipeingredient:
- "1 lb raw peeled and deveined tail off jumbo shrimp"
- "1 (16 oz) can coconut milk"
- "3/4 cup water"
- " Finely diced onion about 14 cup worth"
- "1 tbsp Minced garlic"
- " Curry powder"
- " Salt and pepper"
- " Red pepper flakes"
- "1 dash lime juice"
- "1 tbsp butter"
- "1 1/2 cup rice"
- " Rough chopped fresh cilantro"
recipeinstructions:
- "Melt butter in preheated skillet. Add onion and garlic. Saut√© on low heat until soft and fragrant. Add a few good dashes of curry powder, black pepper, red pepper flakes (if you want it spicy) and a pinch of salt. Keep on low for another couple minutes. It&#39;ll start getting a bit pastey."
- "Add half the can of coconut milk, continuing to saut√© on low heat until it bubbles immediately after stirring. Add the rest of the coconut milk and the water till it&#39;s bubbly again. Add more curry powder and a squeeze of lime juice."
- "Once the curry sauce is hot, add the raw shrimp. Continue simmering on low heat, stirring about every 3-5 minutes. Add more spice throughout according to your preference. Let it slowly simmer, stirring regularly for probably 20-30 minutes. Add the cilantro in the last 5 minutes of cooking. Serve over rice."
- "The key to this recipe is slowly building the flavor. Emphasis on slowly. Your flame should never be turned high at any time during this cook. It&#39;s an easy recipe but requires patience. As always I encourage using your own creativity. Add other Indian spices or substitutions if something strikes your fancy. I&#39;ve seen a lot of recipes call for fresh basil instead of the cilantro, for example. Cilantro sounded better to me üòÅ Enjoy and have fun!"

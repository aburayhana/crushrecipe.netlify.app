recipeingredient:
- "200 g half a can of chickpeas drained"
- "100 g closed cap mushrooms sliced"
- "80 g fresh tomatoes chopped"
- "1 large red onion sliced"
- "Half a carton of tomato passata 200g"
- "60 g chopped baby spinach leaves"
- "2 finely sliced green spring onions"
- "2 mild red chillies seeds left in sliced finely"
- "1 thumb of fresh ginger sliced finely"
- "2 large cloves of garlic crushed"
- "1 good handful of chopped flat leaf parsley"
- "1 tbsp hot curry powder"
- "1 tsp tumeric"
- "1/4 tsp ground cumin"
- "1 tbsp garam masala powder"
- "3 whole cardamon pods"
- "1 heaped tbsp fat free Quark"
- "1 good pinch of salt"
- "1 tbsp vegetable oil for frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat a large saucepan up on a hob, over a medium high heat. Add the cooking oil and allow to warm. Once heated, add the red onion, green onions and the mushrooms. Fry for a couple of minutes."
- "Next add the chopped ginger, garlic and chilli. Stir to combine and fry until fragrant for another couple of minutes."
- "Add in the tomatoes next. Stir again. Then add in all of the dry spices. Give everything a good stir and add in the passata. Next add the chickpeas and water. Season with a good pinch of salt and also add the cardamon pods."
- "Turn the heat down to medium and allow the mixture to come to a simmer. Add the chopped spinach leaves on top of the curry and place the lid of the saucepan on so it steams it. Once the spinach has shrunk down after around 3-4 minutes, open the lid and give the curry a stir so everything is evenly combined. Add the chopped parsley leaves."
- "Place over the lid again and allow to simmer on a low heat until the curry thickens and reduces down and the vegetables and chickpeas are tender. I usually leave it to simmer for anywhere between 40-60 minutes on a very low heat, ensure you check on it now and then to give it a stir so it doesn&#39;t dry or catch. If it begins to dry simply add a touch more water."
- "Once the curry has reduced and thickened remove from the heat. Leave to stand for 3 minutes. If you can locate the Cardamon pods, remove them. Add in the quark and stir through until the curry becomes creamier. Serve up and enjoy! :)"
- "Note: This is a great curry to batch cook on a larger scale, to then freeze as individual portions as a quick go to meal when you need it. I often do this and store in Tupperware boxes."

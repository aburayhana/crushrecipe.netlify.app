recipeinstructions:

- "once the butter is at a nice melt and bubbling just a bit , add one slice of zucchini into the pan. don&#39;t overlap them. you will cook each side for about 2 to 5 minutes depending on thickness and how firm or mushy you want these."

- "turn off heat and move the pan to a cool burner"
- "remove onions before taking them out or just leave onions in the pan and take one slice out at once without getting onion"
- "take either paper towels and put them on a glass plate to absorb any extra butter/grease. you can also just use paper plates."
- "I did only one zucchini.  if your doing more then one. each batch should be started from scratch. meaning : fresh butter and spices.  rinse the pan also so nothing gets burned to the bottom"
- "serve as a snack or with dinner.  plain or with ranch dressing"

Toss the meat with chili powder, cumin, oregano, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, pepper and Worcestershire sauce. In a large plastic bag, combine the flour, thyme and rosemary; add beef cubes, a few at a time, and shake to coat. In a Dutch oven, cook beef cubes and ground beef over medium heat until meat is no longer pink; drain. I did add more spice since I could tell from the recipe it wouldn&#39;t be very spicy. But if you don&#39;t need the spice, and are looking for a great non-bean chili recipe, this is perfect!

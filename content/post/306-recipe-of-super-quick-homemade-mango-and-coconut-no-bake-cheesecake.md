recipeinstructions:
- "Line the bottom of the springform pan with the sponge cake. Combine the sugar and water and heat in the microwave to dissolve. Add the liqueur to make a syrup and brush the syrup generously on the sponge cake."
- "Make the cheese filling. Mix the water and liqueur together, sprinkle with the gelatin powder and leave to soak."
- "Strain the mango to make a puree, firmly pressing it through the strainer with a spatula."
- "Put the cream cheese, which has been softened a bit in the microwave, and the sugar in a bowl and cream well with a spatula. When it&#39;s well combined, switch to a whisk and mix well."
- "Heat the mango puree and milk in a small saucepan until nearly boiling. Remove from heat, add the coconut milk powder and mix well until it&#39;s dissolved."
- "Dissolve the gelatin in Step 2 over hot water and stir it in to the mixture in Step 5. When it&#39;s well combined, cool the bottom of the pan in ice water while stirring thoroughly, until it no longer feels warm."
- "Whisk in the cream cheese mixture from Step 4, a little at a time, mixing well."

- "Make the jello. Remove the inside of the mango with a melon baller."

- "Dissolve the gelatin mixture in Step 11 over hot water. Mix in the rest of the orange juice and let cool."
- "When the mixture in Step 9 has firmly set, cover the top evenly with the balls of mango."
- "Pour the jello liquid from Step 12 over the mango to coat. Chill again in the refrigerator until set."
- "Since I used easy-to-make proportions for the jelly sauce, you&#39;ll probably have a bit left over. Remove the cheesecake carefully from the pan when it&#39;s set, and it&#39;s done."
- "You can probably use canned mango in syrup instead of fresh. Adjust the amount of sugar in that case."
- "Since you can&#39;t make mango balls with canned mango, drain the mango well and cut it into slices to lay on top."

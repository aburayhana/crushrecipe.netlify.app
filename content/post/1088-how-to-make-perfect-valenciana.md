Hello everybody, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, valenciana. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Valenciana is one of the most favored of recent trending foods in the world. It is easy, it is quick, it tastes delicious. It's enjoyed by millions daily. They're nice and they look wonderful. Valenciana is something that I've loved my whole life.

Arroz Valenciana is a hearty and tasty Filipino dish made of glutinous rice, coconut milk, chicken, Chorizo de Bilbao, and saffron. Colorful and festive, it&#39;s perfect for holidays and special occasions! The real Paella Valenciana doesn&#39;t have green peas, but you can add, when its the season, artichoke in quarters. Someone told you to add a bit of lemon juice over it before eating the paella, and I agree it makes the flavour more intense, but the acid of the lemon combined with the carbohydrates of the rice makes your digestion difficult.


To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can cook valenciana using 13 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you cook it.

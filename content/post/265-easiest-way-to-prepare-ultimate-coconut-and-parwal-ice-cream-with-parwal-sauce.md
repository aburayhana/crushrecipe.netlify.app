recipeingredient:
- "500 ml Full Fat Milk"
- "2-3 Tablespoons Heavy Cream"
- "1 Tablespoon Cornstarch"
- "1.5 Tablespoons GMS"
- "1/5 teaspoon CMC"
- "2 Tablespoons Milk Powder"
- "3/4 cup Regular Sugar"
- "2 teaspoons Vanilla Extract  Essence"
- "1 cup parwal"
- "as needed Sugar syrup"
- "as required Coconut garated"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring milk to a boil and reserve about ¼ cup of the milk. Continue to boil the remaining milk mixture while stirring it. You should look for the mixture to reduce a beat which will help the ice cream to be creamier."
- "Add cornflour, milk powder, GMS and CMC to the reserved 1/4 cup of milk and mix well. Set aside. Add sugar to the milk and mix well. Continue to boil for another 8-10 minutes. Taste and adjust for sweetness, if required."
- "Pass the mixture through a sieve / filter to catch any lumps. You should have a smooth, lump-free custard. This will give a smooth texture to the ice cream. As the mixture cools, keep stirring constantly. This prevents a skin from forming on top."
- "Lower the heat to medium flame. Slowly add the cornflour mixture to the milk and stir constantly. Keep stirring and you&#39;ll start to see that the mixture thickens. Keep cooking and stirring till you have a thick sauce like consistency. When you dip a wooden spoon into the mixture and it coats the back of the spoon, the mixture is done. You can switch off the flame."
- "Once the mixture is cool, add the vanilla extract / essence and mix well. Pour into a shallow container close with a lid and freeze until almost set. It will take about 3-4 hours. Make sure the freezer is set to coldest temperature."
- "Take the mixture out, add the cream and whip for 3-4 minutes until the mixture has doubled in volume and the ice crystals have broken up. Again pour into the same container and freeze until set (3-4 hours)"
- "Again remove and whip for 3-4 minutes or until you have a smooth &amp; creamy mixture. Now add coconut crush and coconut grated and add parwal pieces(cut parwal and boil in sugar syrup untill it&#39;s cooked)  Set it to freeze one more time. This time, you can reduce the freezer temperature to normal chillness and let the ice cream set for 5-6 hours."

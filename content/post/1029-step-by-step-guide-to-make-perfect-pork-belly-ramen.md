recipeinstructions:
- "Begin with preparing your pork belly. Combine the soy sauce, honey, brown sugar, peanut butter, lime juice, lime zest, and garlic powder in a bowl and whisk together until well combined. Add the pieces of pork belly to the marinade. Cover and let marinate in the fridge overnight."
- "Once marinated, remove the pork belly from the marinade and place on a plate. Do NOT pat dry; leave the juices on them. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit."
- "Heat a small amount of oil in a frying pan on high heat until shimmering. Sear the pork belly pieces for about 30 seconds on each side making sure that all sides of it come in contact with the heat. Transfer to a baking tray."
- "Put the pork belly in the oven and bake for about 1 1/2 hours until it is fall-apart tender. This can be checked by using a table knife; the table knife should be able to easily cut through the meat. If it begins to burn in the oven before it&#39;s ready, reduce the heat to 275."
- "For the broth, begin by putting the cinnamon stick, star anise, black peppercorns, chili flakes, and cloves into a dry frying pan. On a high heat, toast the spices until slightly darkened and fragrant taking care to move them around the pan constantly to avoid burning. Dump into a large pot."
- "In the same pan as the spices you just toasted, turn the heat down to medium and lube the pan with a small amount of oil and add the chopped onion, crushed garlic, ginger slices, and a pinch of salt. Sweat these off until just starting to turn translucent and then add to the large pot with the toasted spices."
- "In the pot with the toasted spices, onion, ginger, and garlic, pour in all of the mushroom broth and add the Clementine Peel. Bring to a boil, then add fish sauce. Once the liquid reaches a rolling boil, immediately turn down to a simmer. This is VERY important as if you keep it boiling, you will lose a good bit of your liquid."
- "Once on a simmer, add the soy sauce, Mirin, sake, and chili oil. Stir gently to incorporate the flavours and then allow to simmer for about 30 minutes. Taste check for flavour. If it is not salty enough, just add more salt. If it&#39;s too watery, extra soy sauce will help give it more depth. If there&#39;s too much soy sauce, some extra Mirin will help calm it down. If you want more spice, add more chili oil. Do not be shy with your flavours!"
- "When the broth has been simmering for about a half an hour and all of the flavours have been infused, pour the broth through a sieve into another pot waiting on the heat. There should be no more spices, garlic, or onion floating in the broth now. Allow to sit on low heat to keep it hot."
- "Prepare your bowls for the soup. Each bowl should have a portion of ramen noodles, and the white ends of a sliced green onion. Save the green part for later."
- "Ladle the broth into the bowl over the noodles until the noodles are just submerged. Allow to sit for a minute to cook the noodles. It doesn&#39;t take long."
- "Once the noodles are cooked, add the garnishes. The finished pork belly can be sliced into bite-sized pieces and added to the top along with the egg half, bean sprouts, and the remainder of the green onion slices. Serve piping hot!"

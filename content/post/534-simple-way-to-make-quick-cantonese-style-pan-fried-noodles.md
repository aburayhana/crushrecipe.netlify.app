- "Remove cooked meat/veggies and save. Put pan back on medium high heat with some oil (about 2 tablespoons)"
- "Add the cooked noodles to the pan, sort of tilt the pan around so the oil gets on the noodles where they touch the pan. Leave the noodles alone."

- "Now take your pan and flip the noodles in one flip so they land on what was the top. What? Can&#39;t do that? Me either. I used tongs to turn them. Then cook for a couple minutes, grind some black pepper on top, turn some more, more pepper, cook for a couple minutes, keep this up until they appeared slightly dry with some crispy spots. Under done is better than over done in my opinion."
- "Give the sauce one last stir, then add to the noodles. Turn heat down to medium."
- "Use your tongs to constantly stir the noodles until they take a darker color evenly over all."
- "Add your meat/veggie mixture, continue to turn and mix, constantly. Now your goal is a good mix and heated through."
- "Turn off heat, serve. You can add some chopped green onion or parsley/cilantro for garnish if you desire."

recipeinstructions:
- "Make caramelized onions following. You can make time consuming caramelized onions in just 15 minutes without fail.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/143607-oil-free-easy-and-timesaving-caramelized-onions"
- "I normally use caramelized onions that I&#39;ve made a big batch of and stocked in the freezer. If making your own caramelized onions is too much work, use about 80 g of premade caramelized onions."
- "Chop the garlic finely. Cut up the meat or seafood of your choice into easy to eat pieces. I used 200 g of ground beef this time."
- "Put the extra virgin olive oil and chopped garlic into a cold pan or frying pan. Cook over low heat to bring out the fragrance of the garlic."
- "When the Step 4 pan starts smelling like garlic, add the meat or seafood and the A. flavoring ingredients, and sauté."
- "If you are using ground beef or mixed ground beef and pork, add the B. ingredients when you sauté the meat. This brings out their fragrance more. I add more spices at the end too."
- "When the meat or seafood is cooked, add the canned tomatoes liquid and all. Add the A. ingredients. Simmer over medium heat while crushing the tomatoes."
- "Add the amount of water indicated on the curry roux box and the caramelized onions from Step 1."
- "Turn the heat up to high to bring the sauce to a boil, then turn the heat down to about low-medium. Simmer in the way you would simmer regular curry. * Skim off the scum occasionally."
- "After simmering the sauce, add the curry roux and instant coffee granules. Simmer for an additional 5 to 10 minutes over low heat."
- "Add some of the B. spices to the pan to taste. Mix and turn off the heat. The tomato curry is done. It&#39;s best eaten the next day."
- "I add quite a bit of the B. spices. These spices and the caramelized onions are important!!!"
- "Serve on a plate ladled over rice ^^ I sprinkle on some parsley. The sourness of tomato curry is quite addictive."
- "The amount of curry roux to use will depend on your taste, but if you&#39;re serving the curry right away I recommend using more; if you&#39;re having it the next day, use 70 g."

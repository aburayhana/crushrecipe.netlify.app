recipeinstructions:
- "Pull apart the pre-roasted chicken into bite sized pieces and set aside. I like to do this first because it gets a bit messy. Prep all the ingredients before you start cooking. Reserve a handful of chopped onion and hand full of chopped cilantro for garnishing the top of the soup."
- "In a large pot, heat the oil over medium high heat.  I like to use coconut oil but you can use whatever you like.  Add half the tortilla strips and cook, continuously stirring, until golden (about 1 minute). Remove the cooked strips with a slotted spoon and place on paper towel. Repeat with the remaining half of the tortilla strips."
- "Using the same pot, reduce the heat to medium. Add the chopped onion, chopped garlic cloves, chopped chipotles, and spices to the oil.  Cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes, or until onions are tender."
- "Add the chicken broth, crushed tomatoes, bay leaf, and chicken.  Add the salt. Simmer for 20 minutes.  Add the cilantro, diced tomatoes, black beans, and corn.  Return to a simmer for 10 more minutes. Taste the soup, you may want to add more salt. Remember you can always add to the recipe, but oversalted food is just gross.  Before you serve, remove the bay leaves."
- "To serve, put tortilla strips in a bowl, and pour in the soup.  Sprinkle crumbled queso panela, cilantro, diced avocado, and chopped onion on top, and serve with lime wedges."
